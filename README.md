### Conjunction with Express

Starting with **3.0**, express applications have become request handler functions that you pass to `http` or `http` `Server` instances. You need to pass the `Server` to `socket.io`, and not the express application function. Also make sure to call `.listen` on the `server`, not the `app`.

```js
const app = require('express')();
const server = require('http').createServer(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', () => { /* â€¦ */ });
server.listen(3333);
io.listen(3000);
```

### Standalone

```js
const io = require('socket.io')();
io.on('connection', client => { ... });
io.listen(3000);
io.listen(3000);
```

## install dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

## watch in localhost
